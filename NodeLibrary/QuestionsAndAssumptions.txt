There is no consistent way to access children of the various node types. As both the 'NodeDescriber' and 'NodeTransformer' classes
will require a way to get children and push nodes to their respective stacks (to enable iterative methods of walking the node tree),
the 'INodesHelper' interface outlines methods to get children, and push nodes (or children nodes) to a stack.
An instance of 'NodesHelper', inheriting from the 'INodesHelper' interface, will be injected into
the 'NodeDescriber' and 'NodeTransformer' classes.
